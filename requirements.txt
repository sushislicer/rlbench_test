# Core Python dependencies for running the benchmark scripts in this repo.
#
# Note:
# - RLBench/PyRep/CoppeliaSim are not pure-Python and are typically installed
#   separately (see README_RLBENCH.md).
# - We use opencv-python-headless for server/headless environments.

# Keep numpy <2 to avoid breaking common scientific stack dependencies.
# NOTE: opencv-python(-headless) 4.12+ declares numpy>=2 for Python>=3.9.
# To stay compatible with numpy<2, pin OpenCV <4.12.
numpy>=1.23,<2.0
gymnasium>=0.29.0
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0,<4.12
