# RLBench stack (Python-level) dependencies.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - PyRep builds native extensions and requires CoppeliaSim installed +
#   COPPELIASIM_ROOT/LD_LIBRARY_PATH/QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH set before install.
# - These are NOT sufficient alone; you still need the system deps in
#   apt-packages.txt and the CoppeliaSim install.
